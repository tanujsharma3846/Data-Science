    "    - Example\n",
    "        - Many machine learning algorithms require numerical input data, so data encoding can be used to convert categorical data (such as the type of car a person owns) into numerical data (such as a binary representation of car types).\n",

    "#\n",
    "- Nominal Encoding\n",
    "    - It is also known as label encoding, involves assigning a numerical value to each category of a categorical variable.\n",
    "    - This can be useful in situations where the categories have an inherent order or hierarchy, such as \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high\" or \"small,\" \"medium,\" and \"large.\"\n",
    "#\n",
    "- One-Hot Encoding\n",
    "    - It is also known as dummy encoding, involves creating binary variables for each category of a categorical variable.\n",
    "    - This is useful in situations where there is no inherent order or hierarchy among the categories.\n",
    "#\n",
    "- A practical example of when nominal encoding might be preferred over one-hot encoding is:\n",
    "    - In a dataset of movie ratings, where one of the variables is \"rating\" with categories of \"G,\" \"PG,\" \"PG-13,\" \"R,\" and \"NC-17.\"\n",
    "    - In this case, nominal encoding might be more appropriate because the categories have an inherent order or hierarchy based on the level of maturity or adult content in the movie.\n",
    "    - Using nominal encoding, we could assign numerical values to the categories based on their position in the hierarchy, such as:\n",
    "    - G: 1\n",
    "    - PG: 2\n",
    "    - PG-13: 3\n",
    "    - R: 4\n",
    "    - NC-17: 5\n",

    "    1. Identify the categorical variables: In this dataset, the categorical variables are gender and contract type.\n",
    "    #\n",
    "    2. Nominal encoding for gender: Since gender has only two categories (male and female), we can use a binary encoding scheme to convert it into numerical data.\n",

    "    #\n",
    "    3. Nominal encoding for contract type: Since contract type has three categories (month-to-month, one year, and two years), we can use nominal encoding to convert it into numerical data.\n",

    "    - This can be achieved using a function like pandas.get_dummies.\n",
    "    #\n",
    "    5. Scale numerical data: Since monthly charges and tenure are already numerical variables, we can scale them to have a similar range to the encoded data. This can be done using techniques like min-max scaling or standardization.\n",
    "    #\n",
